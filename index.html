        The  Ministry  of  Truth  -- Minitrue, in Newspeak* -- was
    startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an
    enormous pyramidal  structure  of  glittering  white  concrete,
    soaring  up,  terrace  after  terrace, 300 metres into the air.
    From where Winston stood it was just possible to  read,  picked
    out  on  its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans
    of the Party:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
          WAR IS PEACE<br>
          FREEDOM IS SLAVERY<br>
          IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The Ministry  of  Truth  contained,  it  was  said,  three
    thousand   rooms   above   ground   level,   and  corresponding
    ramifications below. Scattered about  London  there  were  just
    three  other  buildings  of  similar  appearance  and  size. So
    completely did they dwarf  the  surrounding  architecture  that
    from  the  roof  of  Victory Mansions you could see all four of
    them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four Ministries
    between which the entire apparatus of government  was  divided.
    The  Ministry  of  Truth,  which  concerned  itself  with news,
    entertainment, education, and the fine arts.  The  Ministry  of
    Peace,  which  concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love,
    which maintained law and order. And  the  Ministry  of  Plenty,
    which  was  responsible  for  economic affairs. Their names, in
    Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There
    were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the
    Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. It  was  a
    place impossible to enter except on official business, and then
    only   by   penetrating   through   a   maze   of   barbed-wire
    entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests.  Even
    the  streets  leading  up  to its outer barriers were roamed by
    gorilla-faced guards in  black  uniforms,  armed  with  jointed
    truncheons.

        Winston  turned  round  abruptly.  He had set his features
    into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to
    wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room  into  the
    tiny  kitchen.  By  leaving the Ministry at this time of day he
    had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware  that
    there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured
    bread  which  had  got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast. He
    took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid  with  a
    plain  white  label  marked  VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly,
    oily smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly
    a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock,  and  gulped  it  down
    like a dose of medicine.
    </p>

        Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of
    his eyes.  The  stuff  was  like  nitric acid, and moreover, in
    swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of
    the head with a rubber club.  The  next  moment,  however,  the
    burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more
    cheerful.  He  took  a  cigarette from a crumpled packet marked
    VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright,  whereupon
    the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more
    successful.  He  went back to the living-room and sat down at a
    small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From  the
    table  drawer  he  took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a
    thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back  and  a  marbled
    cover.
